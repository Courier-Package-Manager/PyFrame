Animation
=========

As we all have realized by now, pygame is not exactly After Effects. 
If you don't have the luxury of GLSL, you're prone to symptoms of:

* Fatigue

* Depression

* Restlessness

* Banging head against wall syndrome


Overview
--------
Introducing your saving grace, the animatiom package of this library.
Not really, but you're welcome.

About
-----
This library brings basically nothing, but offers a tiny bit of assistance
when it comes to animation. As this documentation as being written, I am 
very tired and this will be changed many times over. 

A note on features
------------------
Attatching on from the last point,  it's too early to say what features
will and will not be implemented because things will change over time, 
however I can say that a decent amount of animations will definitely be added
to this library.
